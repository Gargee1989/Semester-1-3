# Series 1: The Journey Begins (Semester-1)
This repository is a digital code diary or sorts, where I am adding all the programs that I've done in my 1st semester as a Software Development major. This compilation is based on all the assignments, lab works done as a part of my course syllabus. It's nothing drastic, but we all gotta start somewhere. Everyone's journey starts small. 

<b> Languages learnt </b>: C programming and Java <br>
